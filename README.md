My feeble attempt to make a more advanced plugin

Using Treehouse's lesson on Creating a plugin, perhaps using metabox.io, and using typer.js, I want to make a plugin.  Here's the details:

1) Text field prompts for the sentences / text 
2) Prompts for the next line ~or~
3) Button that says would you like to add another line?  In other words, the person can add as many lines as they'd like.
3) Asks the speed maybe? (nah, let's keep it simple! ~HA!)
4) Allows for a video background (see http://astoundingdesigns.com/ for an example)

That's it!
